# daily-Ten-ST-GEE

The daily Ten-ST-GEE is an open-source, fully-automated, user-friendly, easily-accessible and much-needed LST retrieval system. Based on a data fusion technique, this system combines MODIS and S2 satellites products for the retrieval of the daily 10-m LST. It applies the RLS straightforward statistical approach over the GEE platform, benefiting from its ability to fetch and process satellite-based information in any region globally and in a timely manner. This information is required in different environmental and urban systems, including wildfires, drought, evapotranspiration, volcano, urban heat, and thermal comfort, among many others. 

The daily Ten-ST-GEE has shown an accuracy of 2.27°C MAE in comparison to two airborne TIR images over the Hat Creek region, in California, USA. A cross-evaluation over the 1-km MODIS LST and an inter-comparison to the 30-m L8 LST in six different sites showed very promising results (i.e., average MAE less than 1°C). As a result, the daily Ten-ST-GEE system can be implemented in areas with diverse climatic conditions.
